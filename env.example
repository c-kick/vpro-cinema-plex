# RECOMMENDED: TMDB API Key
# =============================================================================
# Enables automatic alternate title lookup for non-Dutch film titles.
# Many films are indexed in VPRO Cinema under their original title (French,
# German, etc.) rather than the English title. With a TMDB key, the provider
# automatically finds and tries alternate titles.
